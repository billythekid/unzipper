# Billy's Unzipper Script
An old PHP script that wraps linux's unzip command.

Originally [released this](https://web.archive.org/web/20100223092510/http://billy.the-kid.org/2009/02/09/php-unzipper)(Wayback machine link) in 2009 on my old nerdy blog.

Definitely don't leave this script on your server, it's a huge security hole.

## Usage

Upload this to the web-accessible folder that holds the zip.
Visit it in the browser
Unzip your file(s) and optionally auto-delete this script at the same time.
